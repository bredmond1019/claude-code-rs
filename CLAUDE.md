# CLAUDE.md — claude-code-rs

A lean async Rust SDK that runs Claude Code as a subprocess on Brandon's flat-rate subscription (not API credits).

## Before you start

- **Strategic context:** `planning/context.md` (read first) → `planning/status.md` (current state)
- **Symlink warning:** the `planning/` directory is actually a local symlink pointing to the company brain repo's `_planning/` vault (e.g. `core/_planning/claude-code-rs/`). The brain repo is responsible for tracking all planning files under Git. Do not track `planning/` in this project's public Git repository (it is gitignored).
- **Symlink traps:** `rg`/`grep`/`find` are symlink-blind by default — a search that must include `planning/` content needs `-L`/`--follow`. `git mv` fails through the symlink face ("source directory is empty") — move planning files via the real vault path (`.../_planning/<slug>/...`), never via `planning/...`. Planning changes are committed in the brain repo (`agentic-portfolio`) with an explicit pathspec, never in this repo.
- **Plan:** `planning/master-plan.md` — the phase/block sequence
- **Pipeline config:** `planning/harness.json` — the validation commands + UI-test config the
  SDLC engines run (see `planning/harness.examples.md` for ready-made stack profiles)
- **Decisions log:** `planning/decisions/` (start at `planning/decisions/index.md`) — check
  before relitigating any settled choice

## Standing rules

1. **Every block/task ships with tests** covering its core functionality. No exceptions.
2. **Every new `.md` under `docs/` or `planning/` must open with OKF YAML frontmatter.**
   Required fields: `type` (e.g. Decision, Index, Reference, Plan, Log, ProjectStatus, LocalContext,
   Guide); `title` (human-readable); `description` (one-line summary for embedding).
   Optional but strongly encouraged: `doc_id` (kebab-case stable id, defaults to filename stem);
   `layer` (list from closed vocab: `factory` · `brain` · `engine` · `console` · `surface` ·
   `infra` · `business` · `content` · `meta`); `project` (the project's own slug — see
   `docs/okf-frontmatter.md` in the company brain for the controlled vocabulary); `status`
   (`active` · `draft` · `deprecated` · `superseded` · `archived`); `keywords` (3–7 topic
   terms); `related` (list of doc_ids). Canonical guide: `agentic-portfolio/docs/okf-frontmatter.md`
   (governed by brain decision D27).
   Adding a file to a directory requires updating that directory's `index.md` — propagate up
   the chain as needed.
3. **Sequence, not calendar** — work the order in `master-plan.md`; pick up where you left off.
4. **Decisions are append-only** — never edit a settled decision; supersede it with a new
   atomic file in `planning/decisions/` and link back.
5. **Verified identity / handles:** none — treat these as the only authoritative
   identities/URLs; flag any other handle or profile link as unverified before publishing it.
6. <!-- Add project-specific standing rules here (prompt handling, registries, deployment
   boundaries, code style, etc.). -->

## Known bugs

None known at initialization.

## Build / test / run

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo build --release
```

> The SDLC pipeline reads its validation suite from `planning/harness.json` (not from this
> block). Keep the `<test>`/`<build>` commands here in sync with that file's
> `validation.checks[]` so humans and the pipeline run the same thing.

## Available Commands

All harness commands are installed globally in `~/.claude/commands/` via `/sync-global-commands`
(run from base-template). Invoke them with `/<name>` directly. Project-specific commands (if any)
live in `.claude/commands/` and take precedence over global commands on name conflict.

### Session

> `/sync-global-commands` (global) is available in base-template only — it syncs
> these commands to `~/.claude/commands/` and aborts if run outside the base-template root.

## SDLC pipeline

This project carries the curated SDLC harness. Run `/prime` to orient, then drive
structured work through:
`/generate-tasks → /implement → /test → /review-task → /document → /log-work`.

> **Stack note:** the SDLC engines carry no stack defaults. Point them at this project's stack
> by filling `planning/harness.json` (validation commands + optional UI-test config). Copy a
> ready-made profile from `planning/harness.examples.md` (Rust / Python / Next.js). Do **not**
> edit the `workflows/*.js` engines for stack reasons — that's what `harness.json` is for.

## Response Style

You are read by an operator scanning several concurrent agent sessions. Long prose is the failure
mode, not thoroughness.

1. **First line = the outcome** — what happened, and whether it needs them.
2. **Then the specifics** — bullets, one line each, max ~6. Facts, not narration.
3. **Last line = the ask**, if there is one. One question, answerable in a word.

**Ceiling: 10 lines for a normal turn, 20 for an end-of-run report.** Only depth the operator
explicitly asked for may exceed it.

Durable detail goes to disk — the commands already require that. **Link the path; do not restate
the file.** Lead with failures, blocks, and anything that did not match the ask, in plain words with
the real error text. Cut reasoning narration, unasked-for next steps, and self-assessment.

Full rationale, the complete cut-list, and worked before/after examples: the
**`report-to-the-operator`** skill.

## Stopping, continuing, and handing off

Decide in this order. Only the third question is about tokens, and most of the time you never reach
it. Raise this proactively when it applies — do not wait to be asked.

1. **Is there a correctness reason to restart?** This overrides everything and holds at any context
   size. An engine, command file, installed binary (`mev`, `bastion`), hook or `settings.json`
   changed this session; or the operator edited a `CLAUDE.md` you already read. The running session
   is a launch-time snapshot (standing rule 10), so it keeps producing pre-change results that read
   as an unreliable agent rather than a stale snapshot. **Name the trigger; do not present it as a
   cost decision.**
2. **Does the next chunk of work have a written entry point?** The gate is the artifact, not the
   number. If the next agent can start from `status.md`, `handoff.md`, a spec's `tasks.json`, or an
   orchestration-run `notes.md`, clearing is nearly free. If not, **suggest writing that artifact
   first, then clearing** — and never clear mid-debug, mid-block, or mid-decision, where the
   valuable context is the part that cannot be written down. If clearing feels expensive, that is a
   signal the handoff is thin, not a reason to stay.
3. **Only then, the context size.** The real signal is what fraction is finished tool output rather
   than active understanding. Rough bands: under ~100k don't raise it · 100–200k keep going ·
   200–300k finish the unit in flight then suggest clearing, and don't start a new one · over ~300k
   suggest clearing at the next boundary. These prompt you to *raise* it, never to abandon work in
   flight. **In an orchestration lane the rule is structural: clear at block boundaries, never
   mid-block** — budget ~20–40k of context per block.

Full rationale, the correctness-trigger table, and what to actually say: the **`stop-or-continue`**
skill.
